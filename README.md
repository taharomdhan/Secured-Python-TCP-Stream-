# Secured-Python-TCP-Stream-


Hi There ! 

This is a python project where we : 

-Create a server side using sockets and other modules to establish connection and manage messages between clients 

-create a client side where we create users to send & receive messages in a TCP stream 

-Use cryptography modules to encrypt messages and make the stream secure 

-Implement a 2FA (two factor authentication) for login user 

=> I will focus on the backend application , for now it's only in terminal , i might add a GUI interface but it will be basic , my objective is to make this application secure
